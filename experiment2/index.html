				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I created this generative art piece to imitate this image:<img src=./img/saturn.png></p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This program uses P5.js. The stars are points scattered randomly across the sky, drawn with a random variety of shades of gray and white. 
					They also fade in and out over time, at randomly varying speeds. Saturn's rings are also randomly placed, with slight variation in color, 
					and move back and forth over time. The terrain in the foreground is generated using Perlin noise.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I had fun with this assignment, though it took longer than I expected. I feel like I could have turned it in less late if I made a more minimal 
					version of it, but I wanted to complete my vision of the project. Getting the rings of Saturn was harder than I thought and took a few iterations, 
					the same with getting the stars to flicker. Also, my project is not very performant, and I suspect it has to do with the rings. If I had more time 
					I would adjust the color of the rings and maybe make the color change over time. Iâ€™d also tweak the color of the foreground terrain to make it more 
					clearly match the inspiration image.  I also would need more time to get it to work with different canvas sizes, though I avoided hard-coding the 
					proportions of things.</p>
